# react-projects
Some later Springboard online bootcamp projects, all focusing on front end development using react.
They were all done around February/March of 2021. All package.json files are included. 
As with most Springboard projects, they were completed as assignments and generally only meet the specified requirements, thus they may be unpolished and not handle all potential errors.
That said, by this point several of the projects did not include any starter code beyond what is provided by create react app, and since most of them include relatively small front ends I did take some time to try and make most of them look decent.
